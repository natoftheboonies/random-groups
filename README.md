# Random Groups

Given a list of members, and a target group size, allocates the members randomly into groups.

Also supports *secret* constraints (ensure grouped, prevent grouped) via a hidden pane.  Press `ctrl+shift+S` to reveal and hide the constraints.

On request by a HS teacher who wants mostly-random groups of students.

TODO: Check for impossible constraints.
